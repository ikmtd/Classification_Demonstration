# Application-of-neural-network-based-image-analysis-to-detect-sister-chromatid-cohesion-defects

This repository will be the sample code for the title paper.


It includes the following

1. Data : Chromosome images of WT cells and CTf18 -/- cells for classification
2. Models : Trained models to classify three classes typeA, typeB, and typeC.
Includes 30 each of ResNet18-based and SqueezeNet-based models
3. Results : This folder contains csv files outputting the classification prediction results for each models.
4. Code : Classification_Demonstration_code.ipynb
This code was created with google colaboratory.

## Usage
1. Open Classification_Demonstration_code.ipynb
2. Click open in colab
3. Click Runtime → Change runtime type → Hardware accelerator　: GPU
4. Run the code in order from the top
5. The parts that can be changed are marked with "###" at the beginning.
