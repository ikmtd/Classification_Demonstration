This repository will be the sample code for the title paper.


It includes the following

1. Data : Chromosome images of WT cells and CTf18 -/- cells for classification
2. Models : Trained models to classify three classes typeA, typeB, and typeC.
Includes 30 each of ResNet18-based and SqueezeNet-based models
3. Results : This folder contains csv files outputting the classification prediction results for each models.
4. Code : Classification_Demonstration_code.ipynb
This code was created with google colaboratory.
